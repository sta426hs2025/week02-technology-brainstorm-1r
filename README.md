## Exercise A
**Technology**: flow cytometry

**Description**: Flow cytometry is a technique used to rapidly measure and analyze physical and chemical characteristics of individual cells or particles suspended in a fluid. The sample is pushed through a narrow stream so that cells pass single file through a laser beam. As each cell is hit by the laser, detectors measure scattered light (which gives information about size and internal complexity) and fluorescence (from dyes or antibodies bound to specific molecules). The signals are collected electronically, allowing simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters for thousands of cells per second. This enables detailed population analysis, such as identifying cell types, measuring protein expression, or detecting rare cell subsets.
