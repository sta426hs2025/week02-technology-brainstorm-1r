## Exercise A
**Technology**: flow cytometry

**Description**: Flow cytometry is a technique used to rapidly measure and analyze physical and chemical characteristics of individual cells or particles suspended in a fluid. The sample is pushed through a narrow stream so that cells pass single file through a laser beam. As each cell is hit by the laser, detectors measure scattered light (which gives information about size and internal complexity) and fluorescence (from dyes or antibodies bound to specific molecules). The signals are collected electronically, allowing simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters for thousands of cells per second. This enables detailed population analysis, such as identifying cell types, measuring protein expression, or detecting rare cell subsets.

## Exercise B
**Technology**: Pool-seq

**Description**: Pool-seq (pooled sequencing) is a genomic approach where DNA from many individuals within a population is combined into a single sample and sequenced together, rather than sequencing each individual separately. This method provides estimates of allele frequencies across the population at a much lower cost and effort compared to individual sequencing. While it does not preserve information about individual genotypes, Pool-seq is powerful for studying population genetics, such as detecting selection, estimating genetic diversity, or identifying population structure.

**Application**: Pool-seq´s diverse applications include estimating allele frequencies across populations, tracking evolutionary changes over time, detecting signatures of natural selection, assessing genetic diversity and population structure, monitoring low-frequency or rare variants, and studying structural variants such as transposable element insertions or copy-number changes. In Kofler et al. (2012), Pool-seq was used to study transposable element dynamics in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster, revealing a large number of both known and novel insertions and showing how their frequencies are influenced by selection, recombination, and TE family characteristics.
